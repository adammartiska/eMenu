# eMenu

eMenu is our small dorm idea to create simple, lightweight web application that should help restaurants with ordering process. This application is developed and intended to use by smartphones. Customers in restaurant can scan QR code on their table, afterwards they are redirected to URL where they can order food or drinks. Waiters can see all orders on some larger device (laptop, tablet) displaying state of the orders in the restaurant. With early version of this application we will be offering only ordering process without ability to pay for the food. In the next steps we want to include also payments in our app, but it can be tricky to integrate payment system into already running restaurant's payment system.

## Installation & Usage

Web application will be live on domain www.adamkopapricka.tech. Access to our application should be possible only after QR code scanning.
